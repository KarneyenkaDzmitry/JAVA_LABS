Scrooge McDuck is a cartoon character created in 1947 by Carl Barks for The Walt Disney Company. Appearing in Disney comics,
Scrooge is a Scottish-American anthropomorphic Pekin duck. Like his nephew Donald Duck, he has a yellow-orange bill,
legs, and feet. He typically wears a red or blue frock coat, top hat, pince-nez glasses, and spats.
He is portrayed in animation as speaking with a Scottish accent. Originally intended to be used only once,
Scrooge became one of the most popular characters in Disney comics, and Barks's signature work.
Scrooge lives in the city of Duckburg (which is also Donald Duck's, and Huey, Dewey, and Louie's home city) in
the fictional US state of Calisota (a blend of California and Minnesota), whose claimed location is in California in
the real-world United States.[6]
